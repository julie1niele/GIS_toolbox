The "Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox download version 1.01" toolbox was developed by Jeffrey Evans:

I've uploaded this particular version of the toolbox because of his note:
"It turns out that version 2.0-0 is only comptable with ArcGIS 10.2 and later. For those running < 10.2 here is the link to version 1.01 of the toolbox."
